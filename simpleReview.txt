I wanted a *reliable, *fast ssd for a thunderbolt 4/usb4 enclosure. After much research, I decided on this ssd. Yes, it's not the *fastest ssd, and not the *latest PCIe5. However, it delivers write/read speeds in excess of the bandwidth limitations. I'm getting write speeds of over 2775MB/s and read of over 2850MB/s. And, with the *abundant hybrid cache, the *sustained writes don't seem to recede. Super *fast, with *less temperature/power issues (than the top of the line, *newer ssd cards). It delivers the same throughput as the *newer, *faster cards (which would max out at about the same level, due to the bandwidth limits). Saved some money, which is always a *welcomed feature. In the near future, I'll spend the savings on a *faster card (probably the WD SN850X) when I purchase a thunderbolt 5 enclosure.
Very *pleased with the specs and real world performance of this ssd. Five stars, *definitely.
